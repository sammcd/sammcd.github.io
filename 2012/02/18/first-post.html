<h2>I shipped an app, now what?</h2>
<p>In November of 2011, I shipped an <a href="http://hackernewspaper.com">app for reading Hacker News</a> on iPads. 
Launch week was <a href="http://hackernewspaper.com/2011/11/27/launch-week-recap.html">surprisingly successful</a>.
The day of the launch it was the number 5 top paid app in the News section and stayed there for a couple days.</p>

<p>Now things have slowed down. Over 80% of my total sales happened in November, and most of those happened within 
the first two days of the app's life. Realisticly I don't expect this app to pay my bills, but still
there are many small things I can do to try to increase my app's sales. So Whats the plan?</p>

<h3 id="increase-app-usage">Increase App Usage</h3>

<p>The usual next step is to focus on conversions. However, since its an app store app most of my purchases come
from users buying directly through the App Store. I'm going to try gathering statistics about how
long a general user uses my app. My next goal will be to increase this number.</p>

<p>I'm pretty excited about this, because I was completely surprised by my users when I launched the App.
I have a short list of features that I thought were very important that didn't make it to the 1.0 release. However, this 
list and the features that users actually asked for were completely different. I'm excited to find out
which ones really matter.</p>

<h3 id="more-traffic">More Traffic</h3>

<p>My main thought on Search Engine Optimization has always been that if you follow web standards
properly you will be 80% there. I still think this has some truth to it, but I also think there are some 
small changes I can make to increase traffic. In short, my goal for the next few months is to double traffic
to the Hacker News Paper's site, and double app usage. I am very interested to see how directly this will relate to sales.</p>

<h3 id="why-bother">Why Bother?</h3>

<p>The truth is this app is never going to pay my bills, but hoping that if I can double its sales I will
be able to use similar techniques to double <em>any</em> project's sales. I am currently working on a larger
project with a much larger market, and I hope I can use some of these techniques in that project.</p>
